# Adaptive Reliable Defense Graph for Multi-Channel Robust GCN (REDE)
Official implementation of [Adaptive Reliable Defense Graph for Multi-Channel Robust GCN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882867)


Built based on [GNNGuard](https://github.com/mims-harvard/GNNGuard), [Mid-GCN](https://github.com/huangJC0429/Mid-GCN) and [DeepRobust](https://deeprobust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).

## Usage
1.To produce pre-processed files
```
python MultiGCN/pre_process.py 
```
2.Testing GCN performance on perturbed graphs
```
python MultiGCN/main.py 
```
